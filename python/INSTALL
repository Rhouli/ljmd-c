    Installing the python frontend
    ------------------------------

    The python frontend is built on top of the Atomistic Simulation Environment
        https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase
    which is developed at the Technical University of Denmark.

 1) If not present, install python
   
        http://www.python.org/getit/

 2) If not present, install the Atomistic Simulation Environment
    For the trunk (development) version do

        svn checkout https://svn.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/ase/trunk ase

    ASE does not need to be built, but it makes sense to copy the
    package to your python package repository:
        
        cd ase
        sudo python setup.py build install

 3) Add the MyMD module to ASE
  
        sudo python setup.py install

 4) For the moment, you have to add the directory with the MD binaries 
    (ljmd-serial.x, ...) to your $PATH variable:

        export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binaries

    This requirement will be removed in later releases.


    And you are done! 

    Feel free to check out the examples in <root>/python/examples
    that demonstrate the capabilities of this package
