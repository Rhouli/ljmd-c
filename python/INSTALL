    Installing the python frontend
    ------------------------------

    The python frontend is built on top of the Atomistic Simulation Environment
        https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase
    which is developed at the Technical University of Denmark.

 1) If not present, install python
   
        http://www.python.org/getit/

 2) If not present, install the Atomistic Simulation Environment
    The python frontend has been tested against ASE 3.6.1.3017
    
    For the trunk (development) version do

        svn checkout https://svn.fysik.dtu.dk/projects/ase/trunk ase
        cd ase
        sudo python setup.py build install

    ASE does not need to be built, but it makes sense to copy the
    package to your python package repository.

    Note: The optional built-in viewer of ASE uses pygtk, which can be difficult
          to obtain on some platforms (on MacOS X you can use macports).
        

 3) Add the MyMD module to ASE
  
        sudo python setup.py install

 4) For the moment, you have to add the directory with the MD binaries 
    (ljmd-serial.x, ...) to your $PATH variable:

        export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/binaries

    This requirement will be removed in later releases.


    And you are done! 

    Feel free to check out the examples in <root>/python/examples
    that demonstrate the capabilities of this package
